# 🏀 The NBA 3-Point Revolution (1997-2017)

## Overview
This project explores the dramatic shift in NBA basketball strategy over two decades. Using a historical dataset, I analyzed how 3-point shooting transformed from a specialist tool into a league-wide standard.

## Key Insights
* **Volume vs. Accuracy:** While the number of 3-point attempts per player skyrocketed, shooting accuracy remained remarkably stable, proving players became more skilled at high-volume shooting.
* **The "Stretch-Big" Evolution:** Positional analysis revealed that Power Forwards and Centers showed the most significant improvement in accuracy, fundamentally changing their role on the court.
* **Elite Performers:** Identified the top 10 most accurate shooters of the era, led by Stephen Curry with a career-defining 44% accuracy.

## Visualizations

 ## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of how the 3-point shot transformed the NBA over two decades. By exploring a historical dataset of player statistics, I analyzed the shift in offensive strategies, the evolution of player roles, and the relationship between shooting volume and efficiency.
The study was conducted using a robust dataset consisting of 24,691 rows and 53 columns, covering extensive player statistics across multiple eras.


## The Mission
The goal was to answer a central question: Did the massive increase in 3-point attempts lead to a decline in accuracy? Through Python-based data cleaning and visualization, this analysis reveals that the league didn't just shoot more—it became significantly more skilled, particularly among non-traditional shooters.
